## Coding Standards: The Traffic Lights in Computer Science

### Introduction

A world without traffic lights would be a warzone. Cars not stopping for one another and blazing through intersections would most certainly lead to catastrophic accidents. However, traffic lights serve as an enforced reminder for drivers to comply with basic rules of the road to avoid collisions. Similarly, coding standards are the traffic lights of the programming world, providing a higher protective purpose than simple stylistic preferences. Professional programming requires collaboration, and coding standards ensure that team members don’t, metaphorically speaking, crash into one another when working on the same project. An amateur software engineer can elevate themselves and thrive in a professional programming space by adhering to and mastering a team’s coding style.

### Inviting Collaboration

Coding standards enable seamless collaboration among developers to ensure that a project is maintained. The true essence of implementing a coding style does not lie in the coding style itself but in how programs remain coherent regardless of who works on them. According to CODACY, when everyone is on the same page, “Coding standards also make life easier for your testers, allowing them to focus on analyzing and reviewing your code’s logic instead of fixing formatting and style errors…” (2023). Team members can avoid wasting time trying to understand one another’s unique coding style and instead focus on big-picture concepts to resolve within the code. This consistency allows any member of the team to make changes within the code without confusion or unfamiliarity. CODACY explains the greater hope is for all team members to master the coding standard to the point where, “...you want your source code to look like a single developer is writing, debugging, and maintaining it.” (2023) A coding standard takes different ideas from multiple programmers and transforms them into a clear script that anyone can digest. Efficiency is the goal in any coding project, and coding standards are the weed whackers that clear away nagging bushes so that programmers can focus on the mission itself.

### Mitigating Errors

Nagging and detrimental errors can be mitigated and resolved by implementing coding standards. By including a coding standard, developers can simultaneously simplify the complexity of large programs and quickly identify errors that do not align with the standard. Especially in the professional world, DEVTICAL explains, “The higher complexity of the project, the more likely that the project will be exposed to errors, so having a coding standard will help mitigate the complexity of the project” (2022). Inherently, companies often work on programs containing thousands of lines that require the organization that a coding standard provides. When all team members follow the standard, CODACY explains, “Consistent and clean code makes it easier for developers to recognize code smells and anti-patterns and troubleshoot code when necessary” (2023). Coding standards are essential for boosting efficiency and effectiveness in areas where programmers should be focusing, such as the output and functionality of the code. However, adapting to a coding standard can initially be tough, especially after becoming comfortable in one’s unique way of programming.

### Personal Experience

Programming on TypeScript Playground provided me the same joy I experienced as an elementary student playing on the school playground—simple times full of fun. However, it’s time to face the music and realize that I am too big for the school playground; it’s time to mature and act accordingly. Implementing ESLint as a part of the coding style to eliminate errors has been a pain. This process can be incredibly painful and tedious, especially when the errors are complicated and trivial. That being said, I value ESLint as a training tool that enhances my attention to detail by identifying small issues that I might have overlooked. Small issues can accumulate into larger problems, effectively derailing an entire project. I have come to terms with the attitude needed to work with ESLint: being a relentless editor who continues to resolve even the most minor flaws. Some errors may seem minor, yet this practice upholds the coding standards for quality across the entire codebase.

### Conclusion

Coding standards are the backbone of quality programming by guiding developers to efficiently collaborate with one another in software development. The rules of the standard reduce errors and enhance maintainability when every team member writes code that follows the coding standards. While these standards can be bothersome at times, my experience with ESLint has taught me that embracing these standards will elevate my professionalism and level of work. The process of cleaning up identified errors that do not conform with the standard can be frustrating, but the benefits include a consistent and cleaned-up codebase. At the end of the day, no programmer is perfect, just like no driver is perfect. Without our traffic lights to keep all drivers and programmers cohesive, severe crashes are bound to occur.
