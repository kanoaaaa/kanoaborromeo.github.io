I envision combining my CS and future JD degrees to enter the legal sector, advocating and regulating policies on ethical use of artificial intelligence. I see a need for lawyers who understand the underlying mechanics in artificial intelligence and can probe critical questions against the industry, providing relevant solutions for protecting the public. My interest in software engineering derives from a desire to cement my understanding of the processes that build applications like AI. From an ethical standpoint, artificial intelligence is a powerful uprising area of life that must be kept in check. Whether it is illegally gathering data to train an AI model or creating AI for malicious intentions, artificial intelligence can be deployed in various ways that disrupt peace. I want to understand how AI-related issues arise so I can pinpoint the flaws and hold the responsible parties accountable for their actions. Justice must be served, and I strive to learn software engineering principles to advocate for public safety in the tech space. I want to safeguard the public from malignant actors or tech corporations that attempt to exploit peopleâ€™s lack of understanding in software updates or changes in relation to how that impacts their own data security. Lawyers with experience and knowledge of computer science are needed more than ever to combat unethical usage and creation of artificial intelligence.

	Translating my software engineering insights to the legal sector, particularly simplifying neural networks and machine learning algorithms, will empower the judicial system to make informed decisions about whether AI systems are operating legally. A software engineering background of how AI models are trained and deployed can enhance my awareness of the potential risk and harm to the public. I hope to be familiar with AI model architecture because it is fundamental for the structure of how data flows through the model. Additionally, learning software engineering principles for gathering and cleaning data will help me identify issues with data quality and data bias used to train an AI model. Legal action can be taken to hold those accountable for harmful AI applications by providing clear evidence of wrongdoing within their respective AI models program. 

	In the modern digital age, data is the new gold, and AI is the new gold rush, with everyone racing to mine the best data to fuel their models. However, protecting sensitive information is still a massive concern and priority, especially when it comes to AI systems violating privacy laws. Educating myself on encryption techniques is essential for understanding which parties have legal access to secured data. If I understand how data is secured in an AI model from a technical standpoint, I will be better equipped to regulate decisions that address potential breaches of privacy. This knowledge is the key to ensuring ethical and responsible use of AI. 

	Lawyers who understand software engineering can play a pivotal role in identifying harmful AI practices and initiating policies that ensure ethical AI development and usage. I aim to be a medium, decoding complicated AI and computer science concepts so the general public and non-specialist lawyers can easily grasp them. After all, how many people truly understand what an algorithm even is? My combined understanding of complex software engineering terms and the legal atmosphere can be the bridge that empowers the public to feel safe and understand decisions that AI companies are making. This desire to help people in the legal capacity stems from my first experience in the legal atmosphere. Two weeks prior to the coronavirus shut down, I worked in a clinic with Microsoft's CELA division, translating messages in Spanish between lawyers and undocumented immigrants seeking legal assistance and proper documentation. The lawyers inspired me as they were providing services to people who didn't understand how the system worked. The public needs to know how their data and privacy is being protected in the court of justice.
