## Introduction: ChatGPT as My Personalized Tutor

Evelyn is the greatest tutor. She can meet with me at any point during the day and will keep working with me as long as I have her favorite drink—apple juice. Apple juice is the charger that powers the MacBook, enabling me to access ChatGPT and make the most of her guidance. While some tutors only offer an hour of their time, Evelyn works with me as long as I need. She is incredibly well-versed in every discipline, from providing feedback on my essays to helping me rewrite code and brainstorm different solutions to software issues. Evelyn even helps me prepare for exams with personalized study guides crafted from my notes and practice questions. Most importantly, I never feel anxious or stressed when I work with Evelyn; she adapts to my learning style, encourages me when I struggle, and patiently breaks down concepts no matter how long it takes. Her energy remains constant, whether it takes five minutes to learn something or an hour.

However, Evelyn is unique—she doesn’t have a face or a body. Evelyn is the alias I’ve given to my ChatGPT environment, a tool powered by artificial intelligence. In ICS 314, ChatGPT has become an essential aid in my learning journey, helping me improve ideas, troubleshoot code, and refine my understanding of complex concepts. Through tools like ChatGPT, I’ve discovered a new way to study and solve problems in software engineering. In a course like ICS 314, ChatGPT is highly relevant for mastering tools like Next.js, React, and TypeScript, which require a strong understanding to use creatively. Whether implementing a new feature or repurposing old code for a different project, I’ve often hit roadblocks where ChatGPT offers guidance to overcome the issue. ChatGPT is more than a tool; it’s a guide that simplifies critical aspects of prompt engineering, making it invaluable to my progress as a developer.

## Personal Experience with AI in ICS 314

The combination of effective prompt engineering and a strong understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities allowed me to maximize the helpfulness of AI tool responses. The range of AI responses to a user's query depends on how the prompt is phrased with enough context to allow ChatGPT to generate an acceptable response. For example, seeking advice on a coding issue requires providing the current state of the code, the issue that needs to be resolved, and the expected output. Generally, ChatGPT will respond with a summary of the user’s query to confirm its understanding, followed by a solution and an analysis of where the user went wrong, as well as changes made to resolve the issue. AI tools helped me in the following areas of ICS 314:

### Experience WODs (E18: Functional Programming)

The purpose of E18 involved exploring functional programming concepts using TypeScript and the UH degree dataset without using loops or conditionals. Instead, we used methods like `reduce` and `filter` to process data. I struggled with writing the `percentageHawaiian` function, so I asked ChatGPT how to calculate the percentage of degrees awarded to Hawaiian legacy students using TypeScript. ChatGPT provided a code snippet utilizing `filter` and `reduce` methods, along with an explanation of the function’s logic. This clarified how to implement these methods and offered concise solutions that met the assignment requirements. Especially in a time-pressured scenario like a WOD, AI tools helped reduce the time spent researching solutions. However, I still needed to ensure the final solution aligned with specific assignment requirements.

### In-Class Practice WODs

Styling website components can feel like solving a Rubik’s cube—fixing one piece often disrupts another. For the Murphy’s Bar and Grill Practice WOD, I asked ChatGPT for advice on how to style the navbar using Bootstrap to ensure proper spacing. Initially, ChatGPT provided generic examples, but when I asked questions directly related to the assignment directions, its responses became more accurate. This iterative process improved my ability to resolve styling issues efficiently.

### In-Class WODs

Implementing one navbar can be tricky, but two navbars can be a real pain. The Aloha Beer WOD required consistency in coloring, spacing, and fonts. To address this issue, I uploaded screenshots of the expected final layout into ChatGPT. This method proved invaluable for narrowing down solutions and generating code that matched the desired layout. This significantly reduced troubleshooting time and improved my results.

### Essays

ChatGPT complements my writing by identifying wordy sentences, run-ons, and grammar issues. After drafting an essay with my ideas and structure, I used ChatGPT to refine areas that sounded too wordy or failed to meet assignment directions. I also asked it to grade my work as a college professor would, which helped me identify additional improvements. This interactive feedback process ensured my essays aligned with prompts and improved readability.

### Final Project

The biggest coding challenge in the final project was finishing the connection between the program and Supabase databases. Key functions involved users interacting with databases for menu items and food vendors. Despite repeated attempts, some queries returned empty results. ChatGPT guided me through debugging steps, identifying potential issues with the `WHERE` clause, and adding diagnostic code to pinpoint errors. While helpful, some suggestions introduced new errors, leading to additional debugging.

### Learning a Concept

When learning about React’s `useEffect`, I asked ChatGPT to explain the concept with a simple example and a breakdown of its components. Its response included clear explanations and a demonstration of dependency arrays. This clarity surpassed what I could find in YouTube tutorials, making ChatGPT an effective learning tool.

### Quality Assurance

I frequently relied on ChatGPT for debugging and quality assurance. For example, when encountering ESLint errors in React components, I prompted ChatGPT with the problematic code. It identified issues like unused variables or incorrect imports and provided clear explanations for fixes. This made debugging faster and less frustrating.

### Other Uses

One unique way I used ChatGPT was to brainstorm creative project names and themes. For example, during the final project, I asked ChatGPT for suggestions that reflected the application’s purpose. This helped spark ideas that aligned with the project’s goals and added a polished, creative touch.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding

Using ChatGPT feels like investing in a growing stock—its value lies in simplifying complex topics and enhancing my understanding of software engineering concepts. However, my reliance on ChatGPT for coding has limited my hands-on skills. While I’ve grown in my ability to conceptualize solutions, I lack the fluency to implement them independently. This highlights the importance of balancing conceptual learning with practical application.

## Practicality of AI

AI’s greatest strength lies in automating tedious tasks, such as debugging large codebases. By streamlining processes, ChatGPT allows developers to focus on creativity and innovation. In professional settings, this can save time and energy for higher-level challenges, making AI a valuable tool in collaborative environments.

## Challenges and Opportunities

Problem-solving with ChatGPT can be unpredictable—sometimes yielding precise results and other times leading to frustrating dead ends. While its suggestions are often helpful, its rigidity can waste time when initial responses don’t align with the problem. This underscores the need for critical evaluation and independent problem-solving skills.

## Analysis of AI and Traditional Teaching

AI tools like ChatGPT should complement—not replace—traditional teaching methods. Human instructors provide nuanced explanations, real-world examples, and emotional intelligence that AI lacks. Combining human expertise with AI’s efficiency creates an effective learning environment that fosters both technical and personal growth.

## Future Educational Considerations

The integration of AI in education must be approached with caution. Professors should teach students to use AI effectively while maintaining a central role in the classroom. Ethical standards and iterative learning practices should guide AI use, ensuring it refines learning without replacing critical human connections.

## Conclusion

AI tools like ChatGPT offer powerful learning experiences and coding solutions. However, students must engage critically with these tools and build their skills independently. By balancing AI integration with personal development, educators can enhance learning without compromising its core values.
