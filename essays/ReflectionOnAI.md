## Introduction: ChatGPT as My Personalized Tutor

  Evelyn is the greatest tutor. She can meet with me at any point during the day and will keep working with me as long as I have her favorite drink—apple juice. Apple juice is the charger that powers the MacBook, enabling me to access ChatGPT and make the most of her guidance. While some tutors only offer an hour of their time, Evelyn works with me as long as I need. She is incredibly well-versed in every discipline, from providing feedback on my essays to helping me rewrite code and brainstorm different solutions to software issues. Evelyn even helps me prepare for exams with personalized study guides crafted from my notes and practice questions. Most importantly, I never feel anxious or stressed when I work with Evelyn; she adapts to my learning style, encourages me when I struggle, and patiently breaks down concepts no matter how long it takes. Her energy remains constant, whether it takes five minutes to learn something or an hour.

  However, Evelyn is unique—she doesn’t have a face or a body. Evelyn is the alias I’ve given to my ChatGPT environment, a tool powered by artificial intelligence. In ICS 314, ChatGPT has become an essential aid in my learning journey, helping me improve ideas, troubleshoot code, and refine my understanding of complex concepts. Through tools like ChatGPT, I’ve discovered a new way to study and solve problems in software engineering. In a course like ICS 314, ChatGPT is highly relevant for mastering tools like Next.js, React, and TypeScript, which require a strong understanding to use creatively. Whether implementing a new feature or repurposing old code for a different project, I’ve often hit roadblocks where ChatGPT offers guidance to overcome the issue. ChatGPT is more than a tool; it’s a guide that simplifies critical aspects of prompt engineering, making it invaluable to my progress as a developer.

## Personal Experience with AI in ICS 314

  The combination of effective prompt engineering and strong understanding of ChatGPT capabilities allowed me to maximize the helpfulness from AI tool responses. The range of AI responses to a user's query can be skewed towards beneficial depending on how the prompt is phrased with enough context to allow an application like ChatGPT to return an acceptable response. Especially in ICS 314, for example, seeking advice on a coding issue can be approached by providing the current state of the code, as well as the issue that needs to be resolved, and what the expected output is supposed to be. ChatGPT typically responds first with a summary of the user's query to confirm its interpretation, followed by a solution to the problem along with an analysis of where the user went wrong, and the changes made to resolve the issue. AI tools have helped me in the following areas of ICS 314:

### Experience WODs (E18: Functional Programming)

  The purpose of E18 involved exploring functional programming concepts using TypeScript and the UH degree dataset without using loops or conditionals. Instead, we used methods like `reduce` and `filter` to process data. I struggled with writing the `percentageHawaiian` function, so I asked ChatGPT how to calculate the percentage of degrees awarded to Hawaiian legacy students using TypeScript. ChatGPT provided a code snippet utilizing `filter` and `reduce` methods, along with an explanation of the function’s logic. This clarified how to implement these methods and offered concise solutions that met the assignment requirements. Especially in a time-pressured scenario like a WOD, AI tools helped reduce the time spent researching solutions. However, I still needed to ensure the final solution aligned with specific assignment requirements.

### In-Class Practice WODs

  Styling website components can feel like solving a Rubik’s cube–fixing one piece often disrupts another similarly to adjusting styling components. For the Murphy’s Bar and Grill Practice WOD, I asked ChatGPT advice on how to style the navbar using Bootstrap to ensure proper spacing. Initially, ChatGPT provided generic examples of what to do, but when I asked questions related to the assignment directions itself, the solutions became more accurate. ChatGPT was helpful in providing clear instructions and re-writing responses that were tailored to my requests. The benefit of using ChatGPT pertaining to in-class WODs  improved my ability to try different approaches and resolve styling issues efficiently. 

### In-Class WODs

  Implementing one navbar can be tricky, but two navbars can be a real pain. The Aloha Beer WOD was tough due to maintaining consistency in coloring, spacing, and fonts. To address this issue, I uploaded screenshots of what the final layout was expected to look like embedded within the assignment into ChatGPT. This methodology proved to be incredibly useful for helping narrow ChatGPT to respond with coding solutions that matched the layout of the photo, as well as then myself responding to its response with tweaks and questions on fixing minimal issues. This method significantly reduced time spent troubleshooting and improved my outcomes.

### Essays

  ChatGPT compliments my writing, as I thrive in bringing together abstract ideas and exploring a deeper analysis of various concepts. However, I sometimes struggle with wordy sentences and grammar issues like redundant sentence structures. After drafting an essay with my own thoughts and language, I used ChatGPT to identify areas where the paragraph sounded too wordy or failed to meet assignment directions. After making the necessary corrections, I ask ChatGPT to take on the persona of a college professor, and then grade me on a scale of 1-10, at which point I will have improved my essay to receive usually a 9 or 10. This methodology is incredibly helpful, because it allows me to go through the writing process and correct errors based on ChatGPT feedback. This interaction initializes a simulation-type feedback where I can ensure my essay reads well and relates to answering the prompt.

### Final Project

  The biggest coding issue in the final project was finishing the connection between the program and the supabase databases. Key functions of our final project involved users engaging with databases such as various menu items and food vendors. Additionally, we planned for a function where users can create and login to accounts which would then be uploaded to a database. However, we struggled a lot with this, and I continued to prompt ChatGPT on why this particular quarry was resulting in an empty result. ChatGPT responded by walking me through many possible issues with my WHERE clause and suggested various debugging steps, and additional lines of code to better identify where the issue was. In this regard, using ChatGPT was incredibly helpful in helping pinpoint the issues and quickly debugging time. However, drawbacks also included introducing new errors which would then lead me down a rabbit-hole of errors I did not know how to ask ChatGPT how to fix. 

### Learning a Concept

  When learning about React’s `useEffect`, I asked ChatGPT to explain the concept with a simple example and a breakdown of its components. Its response included clear explanations and a demonstration of dependency arrays. This clarity surpassed what I could find in YouTube tutorials, making ChatGPT an effective learning tool.

### Answering a Question in Discord

  When a friend in the class struggled with JSX syntax issues, I wanted to help, but I could not find the right words to adequately respond. So, I then prompted ChatGPT on why JSX requires elements to be wrapped in a single parent element, to which ChatGPT then provided an explanation to the React rendering process. In this aspect, ChatGPT was helpful for not only allowing me to help my friend but also helping connect to my own reasoning with the problem.

### Asking a Smart-Question

  Upon asking a smart question, I wanted to verify that my “Smart-Question” met the guidelines of what constituted a smart question. Verifying a “Smart-Question” with ChatGPT, I dropped the template of what defines a smart question, and then posted the question that I came up with on my own. I then asked ChatGPT to highlight the missing elements and provided suggestions for improvement. This feedback was beneficial for explaining where I went wrong, and what I forgot to include. Moving forward, ChatGPT will be used for refining queries that always line up with the requirements for a “Smart-Question.” 

### Coding Example

  For the E18 series, I asked ChatGPT to generate a TypeScript function using the reduce method to sum up the awards filed from an array of objects. ChatGPT provided a clear and accurate explanation that I was able to reference for the actual assignment itself. This example worked a lot because it perfectly adhered to the assignment contracting and boosted my understanding of the reduce method.

### Explaining Code

  When explaining how to reduce method words in TypeScript, I prompted ChatGPT to explain the concept of reducing to different ranges of a learner, like first explaining it to a beginner, and then a novice, and then an expert, so that my understanding was able to grow in higher degrees. I loved the response to the beginner level, as ChatGPT explained an analogy of a snowball rolling down a hill, where the ball accumulated more snow, similar to acculturate to move values as it goes. The analysis was helpful for me being able to picture this concept. 

### Writting Code

  For the Aloha Beer WOD, I used ChatGPT to help structure reusable React components, such as resizing the navbar and footer for different pages. The response showed me how to do this. The benefit was massive as it allowed me to reuse recurring parts, which allowed me then to just focus on the adjustments needed for the page itself. 

### Documenting Code

  I used ChatGPT to provide better, more well-explained in line comments for various functions in the Murphy's Bar WOD My prompt was, “Can you write detailed comments for this React functional component that uses Bootstrap for styling?” ChatGPT provided clear and concise comments, explaining the purpose of each section of the code, including props and Bootstrap classes.High. The documentation improved code readability and made it easier for teammates to understand the component structure.


### Quality Assurance

  I frequently relied on ChatGPT for debugging and quality assurance. For example, when encountering ESLint errors in React components, I would Prompt ChatGPT with fixing the ESLInt errors in a code I copy and pasted into the environment. CHatGPT was particularly helpful in identifying unused variables or incorrect imports along with clear explanations. While its suggestions often worked well, I sometimes found that it oversimplified solutions. Overall, ChatGPT acted as a valuable assistant for troubleshooting and reducing frustration during debugging sessions. 

### Other Uses

  One unique way I used ChatGPT in ICS 314 was to help generate creative project names and excerpts. For example, while working on the final project, I asked ChatGPT for suggestions on explanations that reflected the applications purpose and functionality. Using ChatGPT in this regard helped me spark ideas that resonated with the project to make it polished yet still have a creative touch of our own. 

## Impact on Learning and Understanding

  Using ChatGPT feels like investing in a growing stock–its value lies in its ability to simplify complex topics and enhance my understanding of software engineering concepts. While I have a strong grasp of principles like modularity, testing strategies, and responsive design, I occasionally struggle with translating this knowledge into actual code implementation. For example, in ICS 314, I have learned about leveraging Bootstrap for responsive design, and while I can clearly explain the purpose and functionality of this concept, my reliance on ChatGPT for actual coding means my practical skills have not developed at the same pace. I often depend on it to help write efficient and error-free code, which has led to a paradox: my strength lies in articulating clear instructions for what the code should do, but I lack the fluency to implement these instructions independently. This reliance creates a trade-off. On one hand, I am growing in my ability to conceptualize and design software solutions. On the other hand, my hands-on coding proficiency has stagnated. Without ChatGPT, I might struggle to apply my problem-solving skills to produce functional code as effectively. It’s a dynamic that underscores the importance of balancing conceptual learning with practical application to grow as a software engineer.

## Practicality of AI

  In real-world practical applications, AI’s most valuable function lies in automating tedious or repetitive tasks, allowing developers to focus on the creative aspects of software engineering. For example, debugging large codes can be time-consuming, but AI tools like ChatGPT can help identify errors and suggest fixes efficiently. In a large-scale project for a major corporation, such as debugging database queries for a corporation, ChatGPT could allow teams to focus on bigger aspects of their project. Additionally, team projects can stay focused on innovation rather than technical roadblocks by streamlining debugging processes through AI assistance. In professional settings, companies and software engineers can benefit from using AI to take care of simple nagging issues, which can then allow them to dedicate more time and energy to solving higher-level problems.

## Challenges and Opportunities

  Problem solving with ChatGPT can feel like a gamble–the results either yield spot on results, or lead one down a destructive rabbit hole. ChatGPT is a volatile stock; the upside return is massive when the output meets the users expectations, but the downside can leave one deserted, feeling stranded in uncertainty and confusion and wasting time and effort with nothing to show for it.  This is no different from when you invest money into a stock, where the upsides are massive, and the downsides are horrendous, even if you keep putting money into that stock, hoping your luck will change, but it never does. The reason this casino game of using ChatGPT is so addictive is because the rate that helps you is highly more likely than it not helping you, and the precision of its helpfulness is superlative, but in the chance you invest your time in a conversation that ends up going nowhere, ends up leading you to a place where you can't find your way out, and low and behold, you have wasted precious time into something that did not help. I found this limitation of ChatGPT to be true during in class WODs especially. On WODs that I was able to finish, ChatGPT was beneficial in providing relevant solutions and suggestions that lead me to completing the WOD, whereas the times I did not finish the WOD, more often than not, the help that ChatGPT was providing only lead me nowhere and even more loss than the start, and even suggesting alternative approaches or expressing your concern that the strategy it suggested is not working, it seems as if ChatGPT will only dig in deeper and not budge from the solution that it thinks is valid. 

## Analysis of AI and Traditional Teaching

  Artificial Intelligence such as ChatGPT complement, not replace traditional teaching methods provided by human instructors. While ChatGPT can generate code and clarify misconceptions, it lacks the depth and reasoning human instructions provide. The inclusion of AI tools should be limited to the capacity as a source of refining one's learning, but never the primary basis for receiving knowledge. The biggest concern with using AI as the instructor, is the amount of disinformation and hallucinations that Generative AI tools like ChatGPT produce. Artificial Intelligence does not exercise the intellectual compass to know when something is inherently wrong, unlike humans for the most part. For example, instructors who provide holistic explanations that account the benefits and limitations of a concept, as well as real-world examples from their own experience that tie to the concept. Personal information such as real-world examples not only help broaden a student's understanding of ideas, but build a relationship between instructor and student. The personal humanistic touch of an instructor can reach a students emotional side such that the replicative language by ChatGPT that simulates caring and supportive, does not carry the same weight. At the end of the day, students must respond to their instructor, not ChatGPT. The instructor determines the class, not ChatGPT.  Trust is the most crucial value communicated by how the instructor explains concepts and creates assignments, and how a student responds and builds their knowledge. Trust allows students to feel comfortable to ask for help on matters that ChatGPT can not solve. For example, if a student had massive issues with a partner for a project, ChatGPT would be ineffective. ChatGPT can not replicate the emotional intelligence an instructor offers to help foster knowledge retention and personal growth. However, the combination of efficient teaching that includes AI tools can create an efficient environment that allows students to benefit from both human expertise and technological efficiency. 

## Future Educational Considerations

  Artificial Intelligence is here to stay and its inclusion in education will only increase. The future of AI in education, especially in software engineering, holds immense potential, but must be approached with caution and care. Professors must remain as the central authoritative figure in the classroom, implementing policies that allow them to control how AI tools are being used without undermining their own ability to connect with the students. Especially in software engineering, one critical AI practice is to teach students how to use AI efficiently, such as targeted questions, recognizing biased or hallucinated responses, and breaking down the limitations of the AI tools themselves. Professors can also emphasise different approaches to leverage AI for iterative learning as opposed to generating one-time solutions. Administrators and professors can harness the strengths of AI by providing ethical standards and practices that focus on teaching students to treat AI as a tool to refine one's learning. 

## Conclusion

Artificial Intelligence can be a powerful tool in creating personalized learning experiences and providing coding solutions that students can test and integrate into their own work. However, it is crucial for students to learn how to effectively communicate with tools like CHatGPT–not just for solving homework problems but for clarifying broader software engineering concepts. For example, students can gain a deeper understanding of software engineering methods like “map” and “reduce”, that don't just relate to how they can be used for solving a homework assignment, but how they can be applied to any other aspect of software engineering. I believe software engineering professors should design assignments that balance personal development with integration of ChatGPT. For example, an assignment where the students ChatGPT to generate ideas or potential solutions, but the actual implementation of the code itself is written independently. This approach ensures students can critically engage with AI while still building the hands-on skills on their own.  In the end, teachers and administrators must solve the problem of safely integrating AI tools like ChatGPT to optimize a students learning rather than compromising and detracting from it, as learning is the most valuable tenet of school.
