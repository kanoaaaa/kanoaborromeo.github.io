# How 2 Write a Gud Q?: A Guide on Avoiding Dumb Questions

## 12 Sep 2024

### Intro
Yes, dumb questions do exist. Educators misguide students with the myth that any question is a good question. While asking questions is important to resolve confusion, the essence of the question must be qualified to elicit the time of a thoughtful response. Questioning is a transactional process that engages in asking for someone to provide a dedicated response. In order to uphold the asker’s end of the transaction, Eric Raymond outlines the differences between asking a “Smart Question” and a “Not-Smart Question.” Eric Raymond (2014) and his analysis, “How to ask questions the smart way,” begins pointing out how poorly-thought questions frustrate and alienate potential responders. People who rely on others instead of attempting to resolve their own issues are, as Raymond (2014) explains, “time sinks – they take without giving back, and they waste time we could have spent on another question more interesting and another person more worthy of an answer.” Laziness and lack of effort do not merit a quality response.

Additionally, the tone and substance in which a question is framed provides insight into the person’s character. Raymond (2014) challenges askers to create questions that better the community, which he explains as, “one that implicitly contributes to the experience of the community rather than merely passively demanding knowledge from others.” Others are more likely to help when the question serves a broader purpose to the entire community. Potential responders are likely to avoid transactions where the only beneficiary is the one asking the question. For instance, a person inquiring about a solution to their homework is not likely to receive a positive response. You don’t want to do your homework? They don’t either. That being said, asking for clarification in certain parts of the homework is acceptable, as Raymond explains, “It is OK to ask for hints, but not for entire solutions” (2014). Students seeking help need to understand that asking for answers does not equate to asking for help. As software engineers, problem-solving is a critical skill, and thinking through adversity in homework is practice for the real world. Before asking a question, Raymond (2014) advises, “Relax and give the problem some thought before approaching excerpts.” Masters of software engineering are not turned away by those who ask for help, but are more willing to engage with how to approach asking for help in a respectful, clear, and substantive format. Better-stated questions will open more doors to communicating and receiving help from multiple perspectives. Developing “Smart Questions” as opposed to “Not-Smart Questions” is an easy way to efficiently communicate with fellow software engineers.

### Smart Question

Know what you’re asking—a good question expresses the asker’s depth of knowledge while acknowledging what they don’t know. A smart question reflects precision, professionalism, and politeness. The meat of the question is reflective of how much the asker has investigated on their own, or in simpler terms as Raymond (2014) puts it, “Know what your topic is!” How can an answer be sufficient if one does not even know what they are asking? An example of a good question is the following:

“Does anyone in this community have an idea for applying multi-core computation practically in R especially for geospatial analysis?”

This question is a smart question for several reasons:

- **Context**: The asker helps narrow the focus for what they are seeking help on by mentioning that they are looking for an answer particularly involving “geospatial analysis.” Additional context such as specifying the programming language, R in this case, helps the community respond with more relevant information.
  
- **Clarity**: The asker expresses the problem they are looking to address while allowing for open interpretation and a wider scope of solutions by mentioning that they are looking for “ideas.”
  
- **Effort**: The asker implicitly demonstrates a baseline understanding of topics such as “multi-core computation” and “R,” which highlights potential work they have done on their own.

These elements align with Raymond’s principles for what constitutes a smart question that is well thought out.

### Not-Smart Question

A bad question is selfish and a waste of time. Questions that lack context or goals make it difficult for responders to give an adequate answer. Sometimes, a question is so simple that it could easily be found with a quick internet search. A not-smart question shows no effort towards understanding. As Raymond puts it, “Answering questions for careless and sloppy thinkers is not rewarding; we’d rather spend our time elsewhere.” Why would someone help if the asker hasn’t put in any work? An example of a not-smart question is:

“What is the best way to learn Python for free?”

- **Lack of Effort**: The asker doesn’t showcase any research on their own, as there are many free resources on the internet for learning Python. A quick search could easily produce results, whereas the question is just a “time sink” that expects others to do the work for them.
  
- **Vagueness**: The question is too broad and does not apply additional context for what the learner might want to achieve with learning Python. Adding these levels of details can help responders provide options that are more tailored to different learning styles.

These elements align with Raymond’s principles for what falls under the category of a not-smart question.

### Conclusion
Questions are the bridges between uncertainty and clarity. Some bridges are straightforward and easy to follow, while others trap people in a maze of confusion. Society thrives on questions and inquisitive thoughts, as they help redirect and elevate ideas that might not have been considered before. While questions are necessary in life, good questions are highly valued. As Raymond (2014) explains, “If you give us an interesting question to chew on, we’ll be grateful to you; good questions are a stimulus and a gift. Good questions help us develop our understanding and often reveal problems we might not have noticed or thought about otherwise.” People enjoy a question that makes them think rather than a question that creates stress. There are many characteristics of a smart question, but key traits such as a show of effort and clarity go a long way in intriguing potential responders to reply. People should never stop asking questions, but the questions being posed need to be worthy of the time and attention of those who answer.
