## Mastery Through Application

Bruce Lee once said, “Boards don't hit back.” In *Enter the Dragon*, Bruce Lee explains this sentiment before engaging and defeating his enemy. Bruce notes that no matter how much one trains techniques on practice boards, it will never compare with the experience of a true fight. While one can spend years perfecting their understanding of techniques, it is a waste if the techniques are never put to use. Mastery is revealed, not through acquiring knowledge, but through exercising knowledge. In software engineering, the same principle applies–true understanding comes from applying real software engineering concepts. ICS 314 is the perfect course that exemplifies this balance by combining the study of fundamental principles with practical, work-related application. Two concepts that highlight this balance are learning coding standards and agile project management, both of which carried a significant role in my development as a software engineer this semester.

## Coding Standards: Building a Foundation

Good code is simple, readable, and maintainable. Coding standards serve as the backbone of professional software development, ensuring consistency and clarity across different projects. From smaller assignments to the final project, adhering to collective guidelines sets an easier understanding of code. To put it simply, as Professor Johnson explains in the *Introduction to Coding Standards* video, “[Coding Standards] improve readability by ensuring a ‘common look and feel’ to code regardless of who wrote it.” Coding standards provide an underlying common language for the coding language used in a program. For example, in the development of the Honolulu Coffee website, consistent CSS class naming conventions avoided conflicts and ensured maintainability. Tools like ESLint helped enforce the coding standards to catch formatting issues before they became destructive. This practice was especially key in team environments where team members are accustomed to certain standards and work off of and build upon one another's code. 

In the Hawaii Bites project, collaboration depended on a shared GitHub repository with coding standards to make merging pull requests smooth and free of conflicts. Much like how training alone with practice boards won't help in a real fight, writing code in isolation without understanding coding standards leaves one unprepared for the workforce. Learning and applying these standards prepared me for professional collaboration in software engineering.

## Agile Project Management: Simplifying Workload

Agile Project Management is another concept that underscores the importance of transferring conceptual knowledge into real-world application. Agile methodology emphasizes an iterative approach, breaking down projects into smaller, more manageable tasks. For example, in the Hawaii Bites final project, agile practices simplified the development of the application into smaller issues to be resolved one at a time. Our team used GitHub to break down tasks into issues for each member to resolve, such as creating the PostgreSQL integration and designing multiple pages. 

To distribute tasks effectively, the *Issue-Driven Project Management Guidelines* recommend: “To minimize coordination conflicts, create a branch for each task (i.e., GitHub issue). Use the issue number to name the branch to make the association explicit.” The GitHub issue tracker allowed us to update and highlight the progress of these smaller issues from “To Do” to “Done,” visually keeping track of our progress. Resolving smaller issues allowed my team to achieve larger milestones incrementally. 

A cornerstone tenet of learning agile practice is understanding adaptability. Unforeseen challenges, such as unexpected bugs or design changes, are realistic errors that arise in the workforce. Software engineers must be well-versed in adjusting plans on the fly. If a person only trains in a controlled environment without addressing unpredictability, they are only training in comfort and unprepared for real challenges. Agile Project Management equips students to handle unexpected issues and adapt efficiently in professional settings.

## Conclusion: Making Knowledge Count

Mastery in software engineering is not just about theoretical knowledge–it is about applying that knowledge in real-world situations. Coding standards prepared me for collaboration while agile project management taught me how to solve problems in a broken-down, organized format. Both concepts tie to Bruce Lee’s principle: true mastery comes from adapting to real situations, preparing myself for my own challenges that I expect to encounter as a software engineer. It is not enough to imagine what could be achieved with the knowledge learned–but to focus on what can be done and make it happen.
