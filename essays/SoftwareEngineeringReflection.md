## Mastery Through Application

  Bruce Lee once said, “Boards don't hit back.” In *Enter the Dragon*, Bruce Lee explains this sentiment before engaging and defeating his enemy. Bruce notes that no matter how much one trains techniques on practice boards, it will never compare with the experience of a true fight. While one can spend years perfecting their understanding of techniques, it is a waste if the techniques are never put to use. Mastery is revealed, not through acquiring knowledge, but through exercising knowledge. In software engineering, the same principle applies–true understanding comes from applying real software engineering concepts. ICS 314 is the perfect course that exemplifies this balance by combining the study of fundamental principles with practical, work-related application. Two concepts that highlight this balance are learning coding standards and agile project management, both of which carried a significant role in my development as a software engineer this semester.

## Coding Standards: Building a Foundation

  Good code is simple, readable, and maintainable. Coding standards serve as the backbone of professional software development, ensuring consistency and clarity across different projects. From smaller assignments to the final project, adhering to collective guidelines sets an easier understanding of code. To put it simply, explained by Professor Johnson in the Introduction to Coding Standards video,”[Coding Standards] improve readability by ensuring a ‘common look and feel’ to code regardless of who wrote it.” Coding standards act as a shared language for developers, which is critical in team settings where multiple people contribute to the same codebase. 

  While I applied coding standards in web application projects like Honolulu Coffee website and Hawaii Bites final project, their importance goes far beyond web development. In any software project, adhering to coding standards can improve collaboration and prevent errors when revisiting code. For example, in large-scale projects, consistent CSS class naming conventions can avoid conflicts and ensure maintainability. Tools like ESLint enforce the coding standards to help catch formatting issues before becoming destructive. This practice is especially key in team environments where team members are accustomed to certain standards and work off of and build upon one another's code. In the Hawaii Bites project, collaboration depends on a shared GitHub repository with coding standards to make merging pull requests smooth without conflicts and confusion. 

  Coding standards are valuable to any field that requires codes. For instance, a standardized code for financial solutions ensures that any team member can understand and modify it without confusion. Much like how training alone with practice boards won't help in a real fight, writing code in isolation without understanding coding standards that apply across a team do not apply for the workforce where this is essential. Learning and applying these standards prepares me for professional collaboration in software engineering. 

## Agile Project Management: Simplifying Workload

  Agile Project Management is another concept that underscores the importance of transferring conceptual knowledge into real-world application. Agile methodology emphasizes an iterative approach, breaking down projects into smaller, more manageable tasks. In ICS 314, we practiced a version of Agile methodology called Issue-Driven Project Management (IDPM), which organizes work into tasks documented as issues in environments such as GitHub. Each task (issue) is addressed individually, assigned to a team member, and completed in a designated branch of the project. For example, in the Hawaii Bites final project, agile practices simplified the development of the application into smaller issues to be resolved one at a time. Our team uses GitHub to break down tasks into issues for each member to resolve, such as creating the PostgreSQL integration and designing multiple pages. To distribute tasks effectively, the Issue-Driven Project Management Guidelines recommend: “To minimize coordination conflicts, create a branch for each task (i.e., GitHub issue). Use the issue number to name the branch to make the association explicit.” TheGithub issue tracker allowed us to update and highlight the progress of these smaller issues from “To Do” to “Done,” visually keeping note of our progres. Resolving smaller issues allowed my team to achieve larger milestones incrementally. 

  Beyond web application, Agile Project Management and IDPM can be applied to a variety of projects in different fields. For example, in organizing an event, different aspects of the event can be broken down into issues that are assigned to team members, who update their progress on the shared platform. Breaking down large goals into manageable tasks allows for greater adaptability when unexpected changes occur. Especially in research projects, where change is volatile, agile practice can streamline data collection and analysis by breaking each phase into smaller deliverables, ensuring steady progress toward completion. 

  Real-world challenges in software engineering require flexibility, and ICS 314 taught me how agile project management provides the tools to organize work effectively. Software engineers must be well versed to adjust plans on the fly. If a person only trains in a controlled environment without addressing unpredictability, they are only training in comfort and unprepared for real challenges. Agile Project management equips students to handle the unexpected issues and adapt efficiently in professional settings. 

## Conclusion: Making Knowledge Count

  Mastery in software engineering is not just about theoretical knowledge–it is about applying that knowledge in real-world situations. Coding standards prepared me for collaboration while agile project management taught me how to solve problems in a broken-down, organized format. Both concepts tie to Bruce Lee’s principle: true mastery comes from adapting to real situations, preparing myself for my own challenges that I expect to encounter as a software engineer. It is not enough to imagine what could be achieved with the knowledge learned–but to focus on what can be done and make it happen.
