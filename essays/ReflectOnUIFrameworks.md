## Intro

Implementing user interface (UI) frameworks is similar to solving a Rubik’s cube; just when you think you have aligned one side, the other sides get jumbled. Although one already knows what the completed cube looks like, the struggle lies in the complicated steps to achieve the perfected solution. One must be critical and creative with how they approach the cube in making strategic shifts that lead to all sides reflecting a single color. Similarly, replicating a website is a software engineer's Rubik's cube. Software engineers are similarly tasked with understanding the design and function of the website and implementing purposeful code to recreate the website. While there is no creative input replicating a website, the software engineer must be creative in how to solve the problems that arise while programming and working out the quirks disrupting the final product. This often involves troubleshooting unexpected issues such as aligning images and styling elements correctly. The process of troubleshooting errors can be simplified by taking steps back to reassess what led to the problem, as opposed to trying to take steps forward and force further damaging issues. A logical mindset similar to coding in Java or Python can be translated to solving problems in programming with user interface (UI) frameworks. Additionally, combining different web design tools can simplify replicating a website. Using CSS and Bootstrap together has been particularly helpful for identifying where fixes are needed; if an issue is related to styling, I know to look in CSS, whereas structural issues lie elsewhere. Mastering UI frameworks requires both critical thinking and adaptability, as well as a strong understanding of how to balance different implemented web development tools. 

## Mindset

An object oriented mindset of logically breaking down issues in code can be translated to simplifying problems in web development. Over the past weeks, I have gained experience in programming user interfaces (UI) frameworks, which I initially thought would be quite different from programming I am familiar with such as Java and Python. Prior to this course, I had no experience in web development or using web development tools like HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I was not sure if using these frameworks would be similar or different from object oriented programming. And it's true, HTML and CSS do not involve program logic or concepts like methods, but focus on styling elements and defining layout and organization. That being said, in my experience with object oriented programming, I have found it more effective to solve problems by logically tracking back to their root cause and starting from there, rather than randomly trying solutions until something works. Shifting to this approach with web development programming helped me build more efficient websites. For example in the Murphys Bar assignment, I struggled with making the image responsive. The image was not scaling properly, and after trying different adjustments, I realized that the code could be fixed by moving the class to image and switching the ".img-fluid” to the “<picture>” tag instead of the “<img>” tag. This small,  yet significant adjustment, made all the difference in allowing their image to scale correctly. This example highlights that even when web development programming, debugging similarly in object oriented code provides a methodical approach to create polished and responding code. 

## Bootstrap and CSS

A project that implements both Bootstrap and custom CSS can be highly advantageous by having the customizable flexibility built on a structured design. While Bootstrap alone is great for having a toolset of components for a quick secure setup, CSS allows software engineers to tweak specific elements beyond what Bootsetop includes. Software engineers can efficiently create efficient designs using Bootstrap, while customizing specific elements to meet requirements using CSS. For example, during the Murphys Bar Assignment, I found it helpful to focus on using Bootstrap for creating the navbar and footer, and then matching the background color and text style by making the adjustments through CSS. I see the combination of these tools as Bootstrap, the hands molding the clay, and then CSS, the paint brush that paints everything pretty in the end. Bootstraps utility and CSSs customization capabilities provide software engineers the tools to compensate for either tool and create the best layout.

## Final Thoughts

Efficient web development programming can be accomplished by logically solving problems within the code and understanding how to leverage different web development tools. Through experiences such as the Murphy’s Bar WOD, I learned that web development programming requires a thoughtful approach rather than just positioning elements on a page. The blend of logic with a creative mindset to adapt to solving different issues that arise within the code can streamline any carried out struggles while programming in web design Additionally, I have come to appreciate coding that utilizes a mix of bootstrap  along with CSS which provide a structured foundation with the benefit of personalizing web design to meet specifications. In the end, I definitely think that web program development is not my calling, as my mind works better with writing code that involves data manipulation or typical OOP concepts.
