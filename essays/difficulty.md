  The balanced properties of TypeScript provide novice Java users a language that combines the flexibility of dynamic typing with the safety of structured static typing. As someone that only started computer science a year ago, my application of different programming languages is limited to Python and Java. I studied computer science and compiled Python-based programs for the first time in the semester prior to my transfer to UH Manoa. I appreciated Python for its versatility and simplistic syntax. However, my comfort with Python was uprooted upon taking ICS 111 and adjusting to Java and defining types for every variable. The initial adjustment to Java’s style was not substantial, as the innate similarity to Python's logical execution of statements established a common framework for developing Java. With an understanding of Python and Java allows me to view the potential of using TypeScript as a combination of Python's ease and Java's robustness.
  
Being a polyglot versed in languages such as English, German, Italian, and Spanish, I recognize the shared characteristics between these languages despite their nuanced semantic differences. This fascination and analysis extends to programming languages like Python, Java, and TypeScript, which vary in syntax, but follow common logical structures. Much like how some spoken languages share sentence patterns (subject, verb, object), some programming languages also follow similar execution logic despite syntax differences.

An easy comparison to draw between Java and TypeScrip is breaking down the common For Loop structure. Both TypeScript and Java share the same basic logic in initializing a variable, iterating over a condition, and then incrementing as the final step. The only real distinction between the two is the use of let and type annotations in TypeScript, whereas Java requires explicit type declarations like int. The core functionality remains the same in either loop just as some sentence structures remain consistent across different spoken languages.	

This breakdown of similar elements between different programming languages is no different from comparing spoken languages. For instance, the Spanish word "Siempre" and the Italian word "Sempre" differ by just one letter, “i”. Learning Italian after Spanish didn’t require mastering an entirely new sentence structure because both languages follow the same structure (subject, verb, object). Similarly, when transitioning from Java to TypeScript, I didn’t need to learn an entirely new way of structuring loops, only minor syntax differences.

Just as my ability to switch between languages grows with practice, my understanding of programming languages deepens with each new one I learn. My ability to recognize shared traits across languages, spoken or written in code, is an important process in my mastery of a holistic understanding in computer science. 

Grasping TypeScript on a conceptual level is important, but the true test lies in executing TypeScript programs that execute flawlessly. How can a student such as myself, new to TypeScript, quickly learn the language within a week? Athletic software engineering is a new form of practice for me, but I believe it is a style that will make me a better software engineer. The format of creating code under a time constraint induces a flight-or-fight instinct that stresses my mind to think swiftly to solve the problem. 

Responding quickly on my feet is nothing new to me–literally. As a former D1 soccer player, the pressure to win forces the body to react timely and perfectly to execute a movement that helps the team get closer to scoring a goal. Body positioning, spacing between others, and angle at which the ball is kicked; all involve minimal room for error, as error can result in a goal against. The rush to accomplish a goal with something on the line is a rush that excites me. 

The regret of not solving a WOD motivates me to promptly dissect the question and formulate a solution. When practicing WODs, I remind myself that they are challenging, but not impossible, and therefore a solution exists. Finding the solution to a WOD requires creativity and resilience, qualities that I embody. With a strong foundation in TypeScript, an individual can be more creative in how they approach and develop code to solve the WOD.

I enjoy deepening my understanding of computer science, and the w3school tutorial of TypeScript was inspiring to learn more. For example, the w3school description of Parameter Union Operators, which stated, “Using the | we are saying our parameter is a ‘string’ or ‘number’,” was a simple but effective elucidation. The clear explanation helped me understand the concept, and led my curiosity to wonder if multiple union operators could be used in a parameter statement.

Testing this hypothesis in TypePlayground confirmed that it was indeed possible, furthermore widening my understanding of how TypeScript can be used. The curiosity to learn more emboldens my confidence in tackling WODs, even when I encounter setbacks.

 
When one approach to solving the WOD does not work, I re-evaluate the syntax and choice of control statement, then experiment with other solutions. My problem solving will improve as I master TypeScript, but communicating with peers and receiving feedback on different approaches is equally powerful to aiding improvement. 

Working alongside a classmate for the first WOD was helpful in calming my nerves and broadening my creativity to alternative solutions. For example, Lucas, my partner, hinted at the idea of throwing an exception to return an error statement while I suggested including the error string as the “else” statement. As partners, we were able to collaborate with differing perspectives. Individual WODs require the student to be thoroughly prepared in their understanding of TypeScript, whereas a partner WOD allows individuals to converse and contrast different approaches. In the end, practice of any kind, especially a WOD, is beneficial to improving my TypeScript mastery and overall problem solving capabilities.
