## Overview
Hawaii Bites provides a consolidated menu from all food vendors at the University of Hawaii, including food trucks, Campus Center, and Paradise Palms. Hawaii Bites is designed to simplify the process of finding food on the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus. With so many options available, it can be challenging to know what’s open, what’s on the menu, and when your favorite dishes are available. Hawaii Bites allows users to view current and upcoming menu items from campus vendors, filtered by categories like healthy, vegetarian, or popular. The app enables preferences, ensuring users can personaliz recommendations they want to see. Vendors can easily update their menus, and admins manage user access, ensuring a smooth experience for everyone. Whether you’re looking for a specific type of food or just want to know what’s available right now, Hawaii Bites makes it easier for the UH community to find and enjoy their meals.

## Developer Guide

<!-- Developer Guide for Manoa Munchies -->
<section id="developer-guide" style="padding: 20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
  <h2 style="color: #8B0000; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">Developer Guide for Hawaii Bites</h2>

  <!-- Overview -->
  <div id="overview" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
    <h3 style="color: #8B0000;">Overview</h3>
    <p>This guide will walk a developer through the process of setting up, running, and modifying the Hawaii Bites app. The app allows users to browse available food items on campus, filter them based on preferences, and enables vendors to update their menus. It uses Next.js for the frontend and Supabase for database management.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Setup and Installation -->
  <div id="setup-installation" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
    <h3 style="color: #8B0000;">1. Setup and Installation</h3>
    <h4 style="color: #8B0000;">Prerequisites</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Node.js: The environment for running JavaScript on your machine.</li>
      <li>Supabase Account: You will need to create a Supabase account to manage the database.</li>
      <li>Git: Used for version control.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 style="color: #8B0000;">Steps to Get Started</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Clone the Repository:</strong> Download the code repository to your local machine using Git. This will set up the project directory on your system.</li>
      <li><strong>Install Dependencies:</strong> Once the repository is cloned, you need to install the required dependencies for the project. This is done by running <code>npm install</code> in the project directory, which will download all necessary packages.</li>
      <li><strong>Set Up Environment Variables:</strong> The project requires certain keys to connect to Supabase. You will need to configure these by creating a <code>.env.local</code> file in the root of the project. In this file, include the <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL</code> and <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY</code> values provided by Supabase.</li>
      <li><strong>Run the Development Server:</strong> After the setup, run the application in a development environment by running <code>npm run dev</code>. This will start a local server on your machine where you can interact with the app.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <!-- Database Setup -->
  <div id="database-setup" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
    <h3 style="color: #8B0000;">2. Database Setup</h3>
    <h4 style="color: #8B0000;">Supabase Database Configuration</h4>
    <p>The app uses Supabase to store and manage data. You will need to set up the following tables in Supabase:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Users:</strong> Stores information about the app users, such as their personal details and authentication information.</li>
      <li><strong>FoodVendors:</strong> Stores information about vendors, such as their name and location.</li>
      <li><strong>MenuItems:</strong> Stores the food items offered by vendors, with a reference to the vendor and additional information like category and description.</li>
      <li><strong>UserPreferences:</strong> Stores user preferences for food categories, helping to personalize recommendations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the Supabase dashboard, create the tables with appropriate columns. For example, the <code>Users</code> table should include columns for <code>firstName</code>, <code>lastName</code>, <code>email</code>, and <code>password</code>, while the <code>MenuItems</code> table should include <code>vendor_id</code>, <code>item_name</code>, <code>category</code>, and <code>description</code>.</p>
    <h4 style="color: #8B0000;">Supabase Client Setup</h4>
    <p>The app interacts with the database using Supabase’s client. You need to ensure that the Supabase client is properly set up to handle database queries such as retrieving or inserting data into the tables.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Running and Modifying the System -->
  <div id="running-modifying-system" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
    <h3 style="color: #8B0000;">3. Running and Modifying the System</h3>
    <h4 style="color: #8B0000;">Pages and Components</h4>
    <p>The app’s structure is based on Next.js, and the pages are stored in the <code>src/pages</code> directory.</p>
    <p>For reusable components like the Navbar and Footer, the code is stored in the <code>src/components</code> directory. These components are used across multiple pages for a consistent layout.</p>
    <h4 style="color: #8B0000;">Adding or Modifying Pages</h4>
    <p>If you need to create new pages (like a new page for a specific vendor or a new feature), you will create a new file in the <code>src/pages</code> directory. For example, to add a page that displays menu items for a specific vendor, you can create a file under <code>pages/vendors/[id].tsx</code>.</p>
    <h4 style="color: #8B0000;">Database Operations</h4>
    <p>The app fetches data from the Supabase database to display relevant information. For example, when displaying the list of menu items, the app makes a query to the <code>MenuItems</code> table, filtered by vendor or category. Similarly, when adding a new menu item or updating vendor information, the app sends the data to the Supabase database for storage.</p>
    <h4 style="color: #8B0000;">User Authentication</h4>
    <p>Authentication is handled through Supabase’s built-in authentication system. Users can sign up, log in, and maintain sessions using Supabase’s auth module. This is used to manage user logins and ensure that the data displayed is tailored to the logged-in user’s preferences.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Modifying Features -->
  <div id="modifying-features" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
    <h3 style="color: #8B0000;">4. Modifying Features</h3>
    <h4 style="color: #8B0000;">Add New Features</h4>
    <p>To add new functionality (such as an admin page to manage users or additional filters for food items), you will need to create new components and connect them to the database.</p>
    <p>For example, if you want to allow users to rate menu items, you could create a new component to collect ratings and store them in a new <code>Ratings</code> table in Supabase.</p>
    <h4 style="color: #8B0000;">Customization</h4>
    <p>Customize the profile page to allow users to select food preferences or exclude certain food types. This can be done by adding input fields for the preferences and updating the <code>UserPreferences</code> table accordingly.</p>
    <h4 style="color: #8B0000;">Updating Menu Items</h4>
    <p>Vendors need to log in to update their daily or weekly menu items. This can be accomplished by adding a form that lets vendors input their menu items and then store those items in the <code>MenuItems</code> table.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Testing and Deployment -->
  <div id="testing-deployment" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
    <h3 style="color: #8B0000;">5. Testing and Deployment</h3>
    <h4 style="color: #8B0000;">Test the Application</h4>
    <p>Before deploying the application, thoroughly test all the features locally. Ensure that the app behaves as expected when users log in, vendors update their menus, and the correct food items are displayed based on user preferences.</p>
    <h4 style="color: #8B0000;">Deploying the Application</h4>
    <p>After successful testing, deploy the app using a service like Vercel, which integrates directly with Next.js projects. You will need to configure your deployment environment by setting up the Supabase environment variables to ensure that the production environment has access to the database.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Additional Developer Notes -->
  <div id="additional-developer-notes" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
    <h3 style="color: #8B0000;">6. Additional Developer Notes</h3>
    <h4 style="color: #8B0000;">Use Git for Version Control</h4>
    <p>Regularly commit your changes and push them to a remote Git repository. This helps keep track of changes and allows you to collaborate with other developers on the project.</p>
    <h4 style="color: #8B0000;">Branching Strategy</h4>
    <p>Use Git branches for different features or bug fixes. For example, create a new branch for adding a new vendor feature or fixing an issue, and then merge it back into the main branch once the work is complete.</p>
  </div>

## GitHub Hosting Guidlines

To ensure compliance with GitHub hosting guidelines for project management, we are actively adhering to their recommended practices across several dimensions of our project setup and development workflow. By hosting all source code necessary for building our application while excluding derived files, we ensure that new developers can easily set up the system without additional dependencies. We leverage a .gitignore file to prevent derived files like node_modules/ and other unnecessary artifacts (e.g., .DS_Store on Mac systems or development-specific settings files) from being included in our repository. This maintains a clean and efficient project structure and adheres to GitHub’s best practices for managing repositories.

Furthermore, our project utilizes a GitHub organization to centralize team-based development. By creating a dedicated organization with an appropriate and professional name, we streamline collaboration and maintain a cohesive identity for the project. All team members have been invited to the organization and granted "owner" status, ensuring equal participation and administrative access for efficient project management. Additionally, we have established two separate repositories under the organization: one for hosting the project’s documentation and public-facing home page (hawaii-bites.github.io) and another for application development. The index.md file in the documentation repository is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the system, including user guides with screenshots, developer setup instructions, community feedback, development history, and contact details. This separation of concerns ensures that the documentation remains clear and accessible, while the application repository is optimized for active development.

By following these guidelines, we not only maximize the benefits of GitHub’s hosting features but also create a robust foundation for collaborative and professional project development.
